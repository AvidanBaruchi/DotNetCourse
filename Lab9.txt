In my answers im referring to the "ordinary" assembly. the Shapes project is not a strong named assembly.

2. it works because Fusion tries to get the assembly first from the application directory, dont find it there; and then 
   looks for a directory with the assembly name and looks there too. he found the assembly there.

3. same answer as before. Fusion didnt find the ShapesLib assembly, and did not find the ShapesLib directory.
   further more, there was no explicit probing configuration to point fusion into the a specific directory.

12. Yep! Fusion looked for the assembly inside the probing configuration directory in App.config (after trying the other 2 possibilities).
